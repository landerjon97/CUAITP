    <p>AITP is a registered student organization here at Clarion University. We are based out of Techfloor which is 
located in Ralston Hall, room G-42. If you get down to the basement and wander around eventually you will see signs if you donâ€™t know where it is. We, as an organization, strive to better our members through both teaching and learning oportunities.</p>
